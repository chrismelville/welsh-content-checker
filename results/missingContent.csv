But you can also decide you don't want to use cash basis as it may not suit your business.</p><p><strong>Why use cash basis</strong></p><p>If you run a small business, cash basis accounting may suit you better than <a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-records">traditional accounting.</a></p><p>This is because you only need to declare money when it comes in and out of your business. At the end of the tax year, you won't have to pay Income Tax on money you didn't receive in your accounting period.</p><p><strong>When cash basis might not suit your business</strong></p><p>Cash basis probably won't suit you if you:</p><ul><li>want to claim interest or bank charges of <a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/legal-financial">more than &#163;500</a> as an expense</li><li>run a business that's more complex eg, you have high levels of stock</li><li>need to get finance for your business - a bank could ask to see accounts drawn up using traditional accounting to see what you owe and are due before agreeing a loan</li><li>have losses that you want to offset against other taxable income (&#8216;sideways loss relief&#8217;)</li></ul><p><strong>Income and expenses under cash basis</strong></p><ul><li>you only count the money you've actually received and expenses you've actually paid in a tax year</li><li>money you're owed isn't counted until you receive it</li><li>payments count - cash, by card, cheque, payment in kind or any other method</li></ul><p>Examples of allowable business expenses when you use the cash basis are:</p><ul><li><a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/office-property">office costs</a> eg, stationery or phone bills</li><li><a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/travel">travel costs</a> eg, fuel, parking, train or bus fares</li><li><a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/clothing">clothing expenses</a> eg, uniforms</li><li><a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/staff">staff costs</a> eg, salaries or subcontractor costs</li><li><a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/reselling-goods">things you buy to sell on</a> eg, stock or raw materials</li><li><a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/legal-financial">financial costs</a> eg, insurance or bank charges</li><li><a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/office-property">costs of your business premises</a> eg, heating, lighting, business rates</li><li><a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/marketing-entertainment-subscriptions">advertising or marketing</a> eg, website costs</li></ul><p><strong>Capital allowances</strong><br />If you use <a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/simpler-income-tax-cash-basis/income-and-expenses-under-cash-basis">cash basis accounting</a> and <a class="new-window" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/travel">buy a car</a> for your business, you can claim this as a capital allowance. However, all other items you buy and keep for your business should be claimed as allowable expenses in the normal way.</p><p><strong>Other considerations</strong></p><ul><li>businesses using traditional accounting (accruals basis) might have to make some adjustments if they switch to cash basis</li><li>you can choose how to record monies paid or received (eg the date the money enters or leaves your account or the date a cheque is written) but you must use the same method each tax year</li><li>cash basis might suit smaller businesses because, at the end of the tax year, you won't have to pay Income Tax on money you didn't receive in your accounting period</li><li>a loss incurred by a business adopting 'Cash basis' can only carry forward any losses. No sideways or earlier year's tax relief can be claimed</li></ul><p>If you're using cash basis and your business grows during the tax year you can stay in the scheme up to an income of &#163;162,000. Above that you'll need to use traditional accounting for your Income Tax return for the next tax year, unless your income drops back below the VAT threshold in place at the end of that tax year.</p><p><strong>Losses</strong></p><ul><li>any losses you make can't be set off against your other income</li><li>terminal loss must be set against any profits (after deducting losses brought forward) from the same business taxed in 2016 to 2017</li><li>If any terminal loss remains it must be set against the profits of the same business taxed in the 3 prior years. Start with the latest year</li></ul><p><strong>Who can't use the scheme</strong></p><p>Businesses that can't use the scheme are:</p><ul><li>Lloyd's underwriters</li><li>farming businesses with a current herd basis election</li><li>farming and creative businesses with a section 221 ITTOIA profit averaging election</li><li>businesses that have claimed business premises renovation allowance</li><li>businesses that carry on a mineral extraction trade</li><li>businesses that have claimed research and development allowance</li><li>limited companies</li><li>limited liability partnerships</li><li>dealers in securities</li><li>relief for mineral royalties</li><li>lease premiums</li><li>ministers of religion</li><li>pool betting duty</li><li>intermediaries treated as making employment payments</li><li>managed service companies</li><li>waste disposal</li><li>cemeteries and crematoria</li></ul><p>If you can't use cash basis, you'll need to use traditional accounting to work out your taxable profits.</p></body></html>|null
